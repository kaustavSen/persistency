    <h1>Persistency analysis</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="lead">
      Persistency measures how effective an insurance company has been in retaining
      its policyholders. Here we have analyzed the persistency experience of life
      insurance companies over the past years.  
    </p>
    <h2>
      13<sup>th</sup> month persistency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The 13<sup>th</sup> month persistency rate measures the proportion of 
      policyholders who end up paying their premium for the second policy year.
      If a policyholder feels that the insurance purchased is not a good fit and
      was mis-sold to then, he/she may simply lapse their policy after paying the
      initial premium for the first year. This is quite a popular KPI used in the 
      insurance sector.

        <h3>
          <span style="color: #00A0D2; font-weight: 700">Listed insurers</span> have 
          maintained a healthy 13<sup>th</sup> month persistency rate of generally 
          above 70%. However, <span style="color: #FFB81C; font-weight: 700">Pramerica

      Next, if we look at the change in percentage points (pp) over the same
      period as above, we observe the <strong>law of diminishing returns</strong>
      kick in. It is much easier to increase the persistency rate by 20pp from 40%
      to 60% but comparatively harder to get a 10pp increase from 70% to 80%.

    <h2>
      61<sup>st</sup> month persistency
    </h2>
    <p>
      Another measure which goes hand in glove with the 13th month
      persistency is the 61st month persistency rate. The main motivation
      behind monitoring this statistic is <strong>brand loyalty</strong>. If an
      insurer has high 61st month persistency, it is vindicative of
      a loyal customer base who want to remain invested with the company and sees
      value in its product offerings. Generally we would expect a company with good
      first year persistency to score well with the 61st month persistency as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explore this hypothesis further in the scatter plot below where we look
      at the relationship between 13th month v/s 61st month persistency amongst
      all insurers.
